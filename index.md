## About Me

I am a current Ph.D candidate at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York working on Computational Biology in the [Koo Lab](https://koolab.cshl.edu/). My research focuses on developing efficient and interpretable genomic foundation models through knowledge distillation and architectural optimization, enabling scalable AI for biological discovery.

This website contains brief descriptions of the projects I've been working on and my [resume](/assets/files/CV_2025.pdf). 


## Interests

- Deep learning applications in biology
- Model efficiency and architectural optimization
- Uncertainty quantification in deep learning
- Interpretable machine learning

## Technical Skills

Experienced with model development, finetuning, and interpretation (attribution analysis,
in-silico mutagenesis) using distributed/parallel computing on HPC systems.
- Programming Languages: Python, Shell scripting, Java, MATLAB, and C.
- ML & Data Science: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Weights & Biases, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy,
Matplotlib, Jupyter.
- Computing Environment: Linux, Git/GitHub, HPC clusters (UGE, Slurm), Conda, uv.
- Bioinformatics Tools: Minimap2, Samtools, Bwa, and Busco.
